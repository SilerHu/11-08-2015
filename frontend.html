        <p>Descriptions:  We applied two approaches, Random Forest (randomForest,

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/index.html) and MACH (v1), to

test the imputation accuracy for missing values in our association mapping panel. First

we constructed a genotyping dataset contained 2758 SNPs selected from the 92K

iSelect genotyping assay, including 1207 mapped to 3A and 1551 mapped to 3B. From

this dataset, different level of missing values (NA20, NA30, NA40, NA50, NA60) were

then simulated by random picking of genotyped values to be set as un-genotyped. A

total of 10 datasets for each level of missing were generated.  The imputed genotypes

were then compare to the original genotypes to infer the accuracy of imputation.</p>
